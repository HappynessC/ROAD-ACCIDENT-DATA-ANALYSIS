This project conducts a thorough analysis of a dataset encompassing road traffic incidents in various regions of the UK. The key objective is to cluster accidents to identify patterns and high-risk zones, with the aim of offering insights for targeted safety enhancements and reducing both fatal and non-fatal accidents. Recommendations stemming from the analysis encompass managing traffic during peak hours, improving road infrastructure, addressing weather-related risks, promoting safe riding practices for motorcyclists, and enhancing pedestrian safety measures. The project adopts a holistic approach to contribute to a safer road environment by considering multiple factors contributing to accidents.# ROAD-ACCIDENT-DATA-ANALYSIS
